AI-Driven Internship Trainer: An AI-powered tool designed to assist industry
experts in training interns effectively by creating personalized learning pathways,
real-time feedback, and interactive resources.


# *Project Name: Collaborative Task Management Tool*

## *Project Overview*
This project was intended to facilitate collaboration between experts and interns by allowing experts to share tasks, problem statements, and updates seamlessly. The project aimed to integrate backend and frontend technologies for smooth functionality, including AI-based task assistance.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and challenges, we were unable to complete the final product within the 48-hour hackathon.

## *Technologies Used*
### *Backend*
- *Java Spring Boot*: For building and deploying backend services, including APIs.
- *OpenAI APIs*: For handling AI-based features like chat completion and task suggestions.

### *Frontend*
- *ReactJS*: For building the user interface and rendering interactive pages.
- *HTML/CSS*: For styling and structuring web pages.

---

## *Current Status*
### *Backend*
- *What Works*:
  - Basic structure of APIs created using Java Spring Boot.
  - Connection to AI services (OpenAI API) partially established.

- *Challenges*:
  - API development is incomplete.
  - Testing and deploying backend services were delayed due to time constraints.

### *Frontend*
- *What Works*:
  - React app structure and a few HTML pages were set up.
  - Basic components for task management were drafted.

- *Challenges*:
  - Frontend functionality remains incomplete.
  - Integration with backend APIs was not achieved within the given time.

---

## *Challenges Faced*
1. *Integration Issues*:
   - Inability to connect frontend and backend services due to incomplete API development.
2. *Time Constraints*:
   - Limited time to debug and test the application.
3. *Learning Curve*:
   - Difficulty managing and implementing both frontend and backend technologies efficiently.

---

## *Future Plans*
- Complete the API development in Java Spring Boot.
- Fully integrate React frontend with the backend services.
- Optimize the application for better performance and AI capabilities.
- Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure smooth functionality.
