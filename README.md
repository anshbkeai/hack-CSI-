# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# **AI-Driven Intern Trainer**
## **Note**  
While the project is incomplete, it showcases significant progress in building an AI-powered internship training platform. We aim to continue improving and delivering a more comprehensive product in the future.
## **Overview**  
The **AI-Driven Intern Trainer** is an innovative platform designed to assist industry experts in effectively training interns. By leveraging AI-powered features such as personalized learning pathways, real-time feedback, and interactive resources, the tool aims to enhance the intern training process.  

This project focuses on streamlining the experience for both interns and mentors by adapting learning content and providing insights into intern performance through AI-driven recommendations.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Frontend**  
- **HTML5**: For structuring web pages.  
- **CSS**: Styling the user interface for improved user experience.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.  
- **JavaScript**: Enabling interactivity and dynamic behavior.  
- **React.js**: Drafted for the frontend structure and component-based development.

### **Backend**  
- **Java Spring Boot**: Framework for creating and deploying backend services and APIs.  
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based database for storing and managing application data.

### **Other Technologies**  
- **WorqHat API**: Provides an API key for accessing text-based AI models to enable recommendations and feedback features in the application.
 
- **GitHub**: Version control for project code and collaboration.

---

## **Current Status**

### **Backend**
- **What Works:**
  - APIs for basic functionalities have been created using Java Spring Boot.
  - Partial integration with AI services (OpenAI API).

- **Challenges:**
  - API development remains incomplete.
  - Testing and deployment of backend services were delayed due to time constraints.

### **Frontend**
- **What Works:**
  - Basic structure of the React app is in place.
  - A few HTML pages and initial components for task management have been designed.

- **Challenges:**
  - Core frontend functionality is incomplete.
  - Integration with backend services has not been achieved.

---

## **Challenges Faced**
1. **Integration Issues:**  
   - Difficulty in connecting frontend and backend due to incomplete API development.  

2. **Time Constraints:**  
   - Limited time restricted debugging, testing, and implementation of key features.  

3. **Learning Curve:**  
   - First-time experience with AI models and full-stack development posed significant challenges.  

---

## **Future Plans**
- **Complete API Development:** Finalize backend APIs using Java Spring Boot.  
- **Integrate Frontend and Backend:** Establish seamless communication between the frontend and backend.  
- **Optimize AI Features:** Enhance AI model performance for more accurate feedback and recommendations.  
- **Thorough Testing:** Debug and test the entire application to ensure smooth operation.  
- **Feature Expansion:** Add interactive and user-friendly features to benefit both mentors and interns.

## **Acknowledgments**  
This project provided our team with a valuable learning experience, offering insights into AI-driven personalized learning, real-time feedback systems, and full-stack development.  

Although we couldnâ€™t complete all planned features within the hackathon timeframe, this serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements. We are committed to revisiting this project to refine and expand it further.
